                <input type="hidden" id="letra" value="Hey, you
Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey, you
Standing in the aisle
With itchy feet and fading smile
Can you feel me?
Hey, you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in, without a fight
Hey, you
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey, you
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey, you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain
Hey, you
Out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey, you
Out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey, you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall"/>
