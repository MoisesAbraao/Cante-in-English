                <h1>Comfortably Numb</h1>
                <p>Hello<br>
                Is there anybody in there?<br>
                Just nod if you can hear me<br>
                Is there anyone at home?</p>

                <p>Come on now<br>
                I hear you're feeling down<br>
                Well, I can ease your pain<br>
                And get you on your feet again</p>

                <p>Relax<br>
                I'll need some information first<br>
                Just the basic facts<br>
                Can you show me where it hurts</p>

                <p>There is no pain, you are receding<br>
                A distant ship's smoke on the horizon<br>
                You are only coming through in waves<br>
                Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
                When I was a child I had a fever<br>
                My hands felt just like two balloons</p>

                <p>Now I've got that feeling once again<br>
                I can't explain, you would not understand<br>
                This is not how I am<br>
                I have become comfortably numb</p>

                <p>I have become comfortably numb</p>

                <p>Ok<br>
                Just a little pin prick<br>
                There'll be no more<br>
                Ah!<br>
                But you might feel a little sick<br>
                Can you stand up?<br>
                I do belive it's working, good<br>
                That'll keep you going, through the show<br>
                Come on it's time to go</p>

                <p>There is no pain you are receding<br>
                A distant ship's smoke on the horizon<br>
                You are only coming through in waves<br>
                Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
                When I was a child<br>
                I caught a fleeting glimpse<br>
                Out of the corner of my eye<br>
                I turned to look but it was gone<br>
                I cannot put my finger on it now<br>
                The child is grown<br>
                The dream is gone<br>
                And I have become<br>
                Comfortably numb</p>
