                <input type="hidden" id="letra" value="I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An august summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers?
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past, forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky park
Listening to the wind of change
Take (take) me to the magic of the moment
On a glory (glory) night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)
The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
Take (take) me to the magic of the moment
On a glory (glory) night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)"/>
