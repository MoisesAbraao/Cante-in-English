                <input type="hidden" id="letra" value="Arrive at seven the place feels good
No time to call you today
Encore till eleven then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again
I call your number the line ain't free
I like to tell you: 'Come to me'
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love I can't tell you how I feel
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Another morning another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again"/>
