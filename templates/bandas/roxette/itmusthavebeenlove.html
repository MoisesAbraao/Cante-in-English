                <h1>It Must Have Been Love</h1>
                <p>It must have been love but it's over now</p>

				<p>Lay a whisper on my pillow<br>
				Leave the winter on the ground<br>
				I wake up lonely, there's air of silence<br>
				In the bedroom and all around (and all around)</p>

				<p>Touch me now, I close my eyes<br>
				And dream away</p>

				<p>It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				It must have been good but I lost it somehow<br>
				It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				From the moment we touched til the time had run out</p>

				<p>Make-believing we're together<br>
				That I'm sheltered by your heart<br>
				But in and outside I've turned to water<br>
				Like a teardrop in your palm</p>

				<p>And it's a hard winter's day<br>
				I dream away</p>

				<p>It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				(it must have been love but it's over now)<br>
				It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without<br>
				It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				(it must have been love, the winds blows)<br>
				It's where the water flows<br>
				It's where the wind blows</p>

				<p>It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				(it must have been love but it's over now)<br>
				It must have been good but I lost it somehow<br>
				It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				(it must have been love but it's over now)<br>
				From the moment we touched til the time had run out</p>

				<p>Yeah! It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				(it must have been love but it's over now)<br>
				It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without<br>
				It must have been love but it's over now<br>
				(the winds blows)<br>
				It's where the water flows<br>
				It's where the wind blows</p>

				<p>Ohhh! (it must have been love but it's over now)
				But it's over now<br>
				Nooowww!<br>
				(it must have been love but it's over now)<br>
				(it must have been love but it's over now)<br>
				Nooowww!</p>
