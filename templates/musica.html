			One, two, one, two, three, four<br>

			Shed a tear cause I'm missing you<br>
			I'm still alright to smile<br>
			Girl, I think about you every day now<br>
			Was a  <input type="text" name="time"> when I wasn't sure<br>
			But you set my mind at ease<br>
			There is no doubt you're in my heart now<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Said, "Woman, take it slow<br>
			And it'll work itself out fine<br>
			All we need is just a little patience"<br>
			Said, "Sugar, make it slow<br>
			And we'll come together fine<br>
			All we need is just a little patience"<br>
			Patience<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I sit here on the stairs<br>
			'Cause I'd rather be alone<br>
			If I can't have you right now I'll wait, dear<br>
			Sometimes I get so tense<br>
			But I can't speed up the time<br>
			But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Said, "Woman, take it slow<br>
			And things will be just fine<br>
			You and I'll just use a little patience<br>
			Said, "Sugar, take the time<br>
			'Cause the lights are shining bright<br>
			You and I've got what it takes to make it"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We won't fake it<br>
			I'll never break it<br>
			'Cause I can't take it<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Little patience<br>
			Need a little patience<br>
			Just a little patience<br>
			Some more patience<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I've been walking the streets at night<br>
			Just trying to get it right (need some patience)<br>
			It's hard to see with so many around<br>
			You know, I don't like being stuck in the crowd<br>
			(Could use some patience)<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And the streets don't change but, baby, the names<br>
			I ain't got time for the game<br>
			(Gotta have some patience)<br>
			'Cause I need you<br>
			But I need you (all it takes is patience)<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I need you (just a little patience)<br>
			I need you (is all you need)<br>
			This time<br>
